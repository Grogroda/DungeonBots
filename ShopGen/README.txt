There is a file here that I should explain briefly, the "item_catalog.txt" file. This contains a table of information containing all items that will be included in the possible items listed by the bot, this table should be readable by the "pandas" software and should contain every bit of relevant information for each item (prices are always in gp). There are a few columns that might confuse you so I'll clarify them now:

- The "FindCode" column is a column with an int number, each number should uniquely define every possible estabilishment where it is plausible to find that item (so for instance, it's not plausible to find a potion in a blacksmith). This table is still a work in progress as well as "how to figure out that code", but I'll leave it like that for now because I think it should be useful;
- The "Rating" column also contains an int. That number should be used (maybe in combination with the rarity) to calculate the probability distribuyion of that item being in that shop (and this should somehow determine how many of that item should be available, if any);
